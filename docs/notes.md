# Notes

## Open Questions

- Are all the wallets in the from / to clauses? What is the smallest set of pairs we need to build a proper grahp?
  - Differences between from_address and origin_from_address is Token transfers?
  - When plotting the network, should we use all 3 datasets or make 3 different networks?
- Are all TX in the TX dataset? Are DEX trades in the TX dataset? Are Token transfers in the TX dataset?
- Why are there wallets without transactions on Base or Ethereum?
  - E.g: 0xbeec6c7dd90ef9de123ea6e920cd20b7814e86a0

## TODO

- Add provisional sybil list to the preprocessing and postprocessing
- Transaction/Events Entropy
- Explore Undersampling
  - Send the same model + features, **with** and **without** undersampling
- Feature: Null count on the row
- Assign a higher misclassification penalty to the minority class (Sybil). Many classifiers (like XGBoost, LightGBM, Logistic Regression, SVMs) support class_weight='balanced'
- Check feature importances and think about features to add, update or remove
- Ensemble models!
- Whitelists here?

## Feature Ideas

- Wallet Feature: con respecto a la fecha de la transacci√≥n fundacional, contar cuantas transacciones ha hecho el nodo origen en una ventana de 24h
- Transaction Count (Total): Total number of incoming and outgoing transactions.
- Transaction Frequency: Average number of transactions per unit of time (e.g., per day, per week) since account creation.
- ETH Balance: Current Ether balance of the wallet. (Sybils might maintain minimal balances).
- Total ETH Received: Sum of Ether received across all transactions.
- Total ETH Sent: Sum of Ether sent across all transactions.
- Net ETH Flow: Total ETH Received
- Total ETH Sent.
- Number of Unique Contracts Interacted With: Count of distinct smart contract addresses the wallet has sent transactions to.
- Time Since Last Transaction: Time elapsed since the most recent transaction.
- Average Time Between Transactions: Mean time difference between consecutive transactions (incoming or outgoing).
- Standard Deviation of Time Between Transactions: Variability in transaction timing.
- Activity Burstiness: Measures indicating if activity occurs in short, intense bursts (e.g., coefficient of variation of inter-transaction times).
- Timestamp Correlation: Analyze if transaction timestamps closely align with known Sybil clusters or specific events (like airdrop claim periods).
- First Active Date / Last Active Date: Timestamps of the very first and very last transactions.
- Average Gas Price Used: Mean gas price (Gwei) paid across transactions. (Sybils might use consistently low or identical gas prices).
- Total Gas Spent: Sum of gas fees paid across all transactions.
- Average Gas Limit Used: Mean gas limit set for transactions.
- Unique Incoming Addresses: Count of distinct addresses that sent ETH or tokens to the wallet.
- Unique Outgoing Addresses: Count of distinct addresses the wallet sent ETH or tokens to.
- Ratio of Unique Incoming/Outgoing: Unique Incoming / Unique Outgoing.
- Interaction with Centralized Exchanges (CEX): Boolean flag or count of interactions with known CEX deposit/withdrawal addresses.
- Interaction with DeFi Protocols: Boolean flag or count of interactions with known DEXs, lending protocols, etc.
- Interaction with Bridges: Boolean flag or count of interactions with known cross-chain bridges.
- Time between wallet creation (first transaction) and significant activity.
- Transaction Graph Metrics (Requires graph construction):
- In-Degree/Out-Degree: Number of unique senders/receivers (similar to unique counts above but in a graph context).
- Clustering Coefficient: Measure of how clustered the wallet's neighbors are.
- PageRank/Centrality Scores: Measures of importance/influence within the transaction graph.
- Calculate features separately for each chain (e.g., eth_tx_count, base_tx_count, eth_total_swap_volume, base_total_swap_volume).
- Calculate combined features (e.g., total_tx_count = eth_tx_count + base_tx_count).
- Calculate ratio features (e.g., eth_tx_count / total_tx_count).
- Features indicating potential bridging activity (e.g., interaction with known bridge contracts).
- Detection of Specific Motifs: Identifying patterns like fan-out (one address funding many) or fan-in (many addresses sending to one).
- Number of Token Types Held: Count of distinct ERC-20/ERC-721 tokens currently held (requires tracking transfers).
- Number of Token Types Transferred: Count of distinct token types ever transferred (in or out).
- Total Token Transfers (Incoming/Outgoing): Count of all ERC-20/ERC-721 transfer events.
- Value of Tokens Held/Transferred: Estimated USD or ETH value (requires price oracles/historical data, can be complex).
- Airdrop Token Interaction: Boolean flag or count of interactions with specific, known airdropped tokens. (Sybils often farm airdrops).
- Token Portfolio Similarity: Measure of how similar the wallet's token holdings are to other wallets (especially suspected Sybils).
- Frequency of Token Swaps: Number of interactions with DEX swap functions.
- Initial Funding Source: Address that first sent ETH to the wallet. Check if it's a known CEX, a known Sybil funder, or a fresh wallet.
- Initial Funding Amount: Amount of ETH received in the first transaction. (Sybils often receive small, identical amounts).
- Funding Pattern: Whether the wallet was funded once or received multiple small funding transactions, potentially from the same source(s).
- Contract Creator: Boolean flag indicating if the wallet has deployed any smart contracts. (Sybils rarely deploy contracts).
- Specific Function Calls: Frequency of calls to specific functions known to be related to Sybil activities (e.g., claim(), transfer(), multisend()).

  - Identify user funding origin, focusing on CEX/DEX and bridges (over 50% of funders).
  - Mark the first native token transfer to each account as the funding transaction.
  - Trace LZ user funding txes, over 24hr timeframe and cluster known entities
  - Large-Scale Funding:  Over X wallets funded within the same 24-hour timeframe.
  - Identical Funding Sources: Txes originating from the same source
  - Behavioral Similarities: Users w/ similar patterns in their transactions.
  - Funding Amount: First funding amount for each wallet (in native token).
  - Number of Transactions to LayerZero: A comparable number of transactions directed towards the LayerZero protocol.
